Assistant: {'message': "Great, Mohamed! Your fitness goal is muscle gain and you're a beginner. Based on your information, I'll create a customized exercise plan for you. As a beginner with a muscle gain goal, I recommend starting with 3-4 times of weight training per week, focusing on compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, and bench press. Additionally, include cardio exercises 2-3 times a week for 20-30 minutes. Aim to eat a calorie-surplus diet with a balance of protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. Here's a sample workout plan: Monday (Chest and Triceps): Barbell Bench Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps), Incline Dumbbell Press (3 sets of 10-15 reps), Tricep Pushdown (3 sets of 10-12 reps). Wednesday (Back and Biceps): Pull-ups (3 sets of 8-12 reps), Barbell Rows (3 sets of 8-12 reps), Dumbbell Bicep Curls (3 sets of 10-12 reps). Friday (Legs and Shoulders): Squats (3 sets of 8-12 reps), Leg Press (3 sets of 10-12 reps), Standing Military Press (3 sets of 8-12 reps). Remember to start with lighter weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger. Also, make sure to warm up before each workout and stretch afterwards.", 'user_info': {'name': 'Mohamed', 'age': '21', 'height': '187', 'weight': '86', 'fitness_goal': 'muscle gain', 'fitness_level': 'beginner', 'bmi': '24.7'}}
